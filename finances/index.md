The Netherlands has a complex system of taxation, benefits and insurance. It can be a mess trying to figure all of it out. The pages on this site attempt to explain these topics as well as possible, specified to residents of the Wauwhaus.

The following topics are covered:

- [Municipal taxes (BsGW)]({{'/finances/municipal-taxes' | absolute_url}})
- [Subsidies]({{'/finances/subsidies' | absolute_url}})
- [Health insurance](({{'/finances/health-insurance' | absolute_url}}))
- [Student financing](({{'/finances/student-financing' | absolute_url}}))
