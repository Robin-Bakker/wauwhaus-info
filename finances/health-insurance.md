As a student you are generally not allowed to take out Dutch health insurance. Instead, you are required to rely on your (international) health insurance.

However, if you start working in the Netherlands at a (side-)job or paid internship you will be required to obtain Dutch health insurance. If you do, make sure to apply for [health insurance subsidy]({{'/finances/subsidies' | absolute_url}}).

The website [I am expat](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/insurances-netherlands/dutch-health-insurance%E3%80%80) provides information on health insurance, where to obtain it, and the Dutch healthcare system in general. Please refer to that website for more information.
