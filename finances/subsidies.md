The Dutch government provides several subsidies to residents of the Netherlands. For residents of the Wauwhaus there are two most relevant: rent subsidy and health insurance subsidy.

## Rent subsidy

Wauwhaus tenants renting an individual studio may qualify for rent subsidy. This subsidy amounts to a significant part of the rent. The following [conditions apply](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/benefits/moving_to_the_netherlands/i_live_in_a_rented_house/):

- You are 18 years of age or older. You rent independent accommodation.
- You, your possible benefit partner, and co-occupants, aged 18 years or older, are registered at your home address in the Netherlands.
- Your rent, (combined) income and capital are not too high.
- You have the nationality of an EU country, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland. Are you from another country? In that case, you need a valid residence permit or work permit.

You can apply for the rent subsidy via [Mijn Toeslagen](https://mijn.toeslagen.nl/default.aspx) (redirects to DigiD).

While applying, you will be asked for your base rent (*kale huur*). This is your rent without service costs. You can find this amount in your contract. It should be around € 580 for a studio (2022).

You will also be asked about the service costs. Here, you need to fill out the following:

| Type of costs                                              | Amount |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Energiekosten voor gemeenschappelijke ruimten per maand    | € 10   |
| Schoonmaakkosten voor gemeenschappelijke ruimten per maand | € 0    |
| Huismeesterkosten per maand                                | € 10   |
| Kosten voor dienst- en recreatieruimten per maand          | € 0    |

The costs for a *woonwagenstandplaats* are also zero.

## Health insurance subsidy

If you have a [Dutch health insurance]({{'/finances/health-insurance' | absolute_url}}), you may qualify for a health insurance subsidy. This subsidy amounts to a maximum of € 111 per month (2022), [dependent on your income](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/nl/zorgtoeslag/content/hoeveel-zorgtoeslag).
