title: Tax Waiver
---

€ 500 each year is a lot of money, and many students will have difficulty paying this amount. BsGW provides a tax waiver for low-income households. Most students qualify for this waiver, even if applying for it is a hassle.

## Conditions

You qualify for a tax waiver if you meet the following criteria (as of 2022):

- Your net assets amount to at most € 1.400,00.
- Your monthly income is below € 1.091,71.
- You have not yet paid your tax bill. Or you have paid your tax bill no longer than 3 months ago.

Net assets include any debt you may owe, including any debts due to student financing (see [article 12 Uitvoeringsregeling Invorderingswet 1990](https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0004766&hoofdstuk=II&afdeling=2&artikel=12&z=2022-01-01&g=2022-01-01)). BsGW, however, does not take any debt into account while calculating your net assets. This is incorrect and waivers are granted if your net assets fall below the amount mentioned.

## How to apply?

You can apply for the waiver in one of two ways: online or via letter.

### Applying online

Applying online occurs via [my BsGW](https://bsgw.nl/nl/veel-gestelde-vragen/wijzigingen/mijn-bsgw), which is only available in Dutch and requires you to have obtained a DigiD. 

[MyMaastricht](https://mymaastricht.nl/finances/benefits/kwijtschelding-bsgw/) has created excellent guidance on how to fill in this form. Please follow their [guidance document <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-file-pdf-box"></span>]({{'/public/manuals/bsgw-tax-waiver-guidance.pdf' | absolute_url}}) for instructions.

If BsGW is unable to verify the information provided online, they will send you the tax waiver form via mail and ask you to provide more information.

### Applying via letter

If you are not comfortable with requesting the waiver online, you can apply through a paper form.

Request a paper application form for a tax waiver (in Dutch: *kwijtschelding*) via +31 (0)88 8420420. They use a recording in Dutch. The following steps may help (courtesy of MyMaastricht):

1. The recording first asks if you are a private or a legal person. Press `1` to indicate that you are a private person, and not a company.
2. Wait for the recording to finish. Type in your BSN and close with a `#`.
3. Wait for the recording to finish and press `2` to indicate you are calling about the tax waiver.
4. You are now talking with an actual person. Politely ask them to talk English.
5. Ask for a tax waiver form. They will ask for the tax bill number (*aanslagnummer*) and file number (*dossiernummer*). These are listed on your tax bill (near the top).
6. The support agent will confirm that a waiver form will be sent.

You will be sent a paper form in about five working days which you can fill out and return by mail. A translation of this form can be found [here <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-file-pdf-box"></span>]({{'/public/manuals/bsgw-tax-waiver-form.pdf' | absolute_url}}), courtesy of MyMaastricht. Please note that this translation states that you are not eligible for a waiver if you have more than € 1400 in your bank account. This does not apply if you have debts that compensate for your assets.

## Additional information

If the BsGW are unable to verify the details you provided in that form, they will send you a request for additional information. This request can take one of two forms. They either send you a tax waiver form, or they deny your tax waiver for specific reasons.

The tax waiver form ([translation <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-file-pdf-box"></span>]({{'/public/manuals/bsgw-tax-waiver-form.pdf' | absolute_url}})) asks you to attach specific documents. Specifically, they want you to provide the following:

- Bank, savings and investment account statements showing all transactions over the past four weeks.
- DUO award letter (if you receive student financing)
- Copy of rental contract
- Any relevant subsidy decisions

Note that they do not ask for debt statements. If you have any debts, please ensure that you attach these as well.

If BsGW denies your application for an *automated* waiver, provide the following details through the contact form in [MyBsGW](https://bsgw.nl/nl/veel-gestelde-vragen/wijzigingen/mijn-bsgw):

- Proof of total assets
  - Bank account statements
  - Savings account statements
  - Investment account statements
  - Debt statements
  - Overview showing that you do not surpass the asset limits
- Proof of income below standard amount
  - Salary slips, or
  - Letter stating that you have not receive any income over the past 3 months.

BsGW will reply with a decision up to 12 weeks after receiving the additional documents. You do not have to pay while a waiver request is active.
