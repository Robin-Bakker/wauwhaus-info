Every year you will receive a letter from the [*Belastingsamenwerking Gemeenten en Waterschappen Limburg*](https://bsgw.nl/en). This tax bill covers garbage, sewage, water system and water purification taxes, which amounts to around € 500 per year. An example letter for the year 2022 is available [here. <span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-file-pdf-box"></span>]({{ '/public/manuals/bsgw-aanslag-voorbeeld.pdf'  | absolute_url }})

The letter includes instructions on how to pay. You can transfer the amount owed via bank transfer. Include the tax bill number (*aanslagnummer*) in the description of the payment. BsGW's bank details are the following:

## Frequently asked questions

<dl>
    <dt>€ 500 is too high, do I have to pay the full amount?</dt>
    <dd>They are proper taxes that you do owe. But, you may qualify for a <a href="{{'finances/municipal-taxes/tax-waiver' | absolute_url}}">tax waiver</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Why are these taxes not included in the service costs?</dt>
    <dd>The service costs are costs incurred by the landlord in providing services to its tenants. These taxes are levied directly on the residents of the building, and are therefore not included in the service costs.</dd>

    <dt>Why did I receive a letter from the BsGW in the name of someone else?</dt>
    <dd>The previous tenant has most likely not yet deregistered from your address. Ask the previous tenant to <a href="https://www.gemeentemaastricht.nl/en/moving-abroad">notify the municipality</a>, or ask the municipality to start an <a href="https://www.gemeentemaastricht.nl/en/moving-and-housing/address-investigation">address enquiry</a>. Then return the letter to BsGW, without opening it.</dd>

    <dt>What happens if I do not pay?</dt>
    <dd>You will receive a reminder after the due date has passed. This reminder asks you to pay within fourteen days. You will receive a warrant if you do not pay after the reminder. BsGW will forcibly withdraw the amount due from your bank account if you still do not pay. Each action taken by BsGW will increase the amount due.</dd>
