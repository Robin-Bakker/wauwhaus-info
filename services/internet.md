Internet access is provided by ittdesk. 

## Room access
Each room can access internet through a port located near the desk. You can use a network cable to plug in to gain access to the internet. The internet connection is limited to a transfer speed of 100 Mbps.

Wifi is not provided in the rooms themself. You will need to utilize a router with a built-in wireless access point. This device connects directly to the internet port and will provide you with your own network.

You can purchase a router at the [MediaMarkt](https://www.mediamarkt.nl/nl/store/mediamarkt-maastricht-866), [online](https://tweakers.net/modems-en-routers/vergelijken/#filter:TYmxCsMgGAbf5ZszaCE0-ABtKXRyDBlEviY_SCIqGRJ899it03F3J2TdmYpdtmgZ6ItsK8zXhcwO0c20chBGK9U0iedH2m-SI_1DQmHKMCduur__uLsAM-LtMNUOg9LDX-2fr6P1Wi8) or any other general electronics store. Please make sure to purchase a router that supports 5GHz, as older technology suffers from congestion.

A setup guide is available at [this location. <span class="mdi mdi-file-pdf-box"></span>]({{ '/public/manuals/internet-manual.pdf'  | absolute_url }})

## Common access
The common areas are serviced by a public wifi network. Details are provided below.

- **Network name (SSID)**: `Ziggo_ittdesk_wifi`
- **Password**: `Wauwhaus2020`

It is possible that your internet speed over wifi is faster than the speed available through the network port in your room, as the wifi speed does not appear to be limited to 100 Mbps.
