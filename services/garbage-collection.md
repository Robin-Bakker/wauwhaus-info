title: Garbage collection
---

Everyone produces garbage, and Wauwhaus has some options for getting rid of garbage.

There are four garbage containers located in the basement of the building. These containers are emptied twice a week by [Rd4](https://rd4.nl). 

The containers in the basement are meant to be used for **residual waste** only. Recycleable waste can be disposed of at sorting stations. Information on these sorting stations can be found on the [municipality's website](https://www.gemeentemaastricht.nl/en/waste-and-environment/sorting-stations-and-recycling-centres).

The closes sorting station is located on the [Heerderweg](https://goo.gl/maps/RF9L6W1z1LEdk4Lg7).
