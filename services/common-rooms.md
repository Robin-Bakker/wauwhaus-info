The Wauwhaus contains 5 common rooms. These common rooms are available to use for all residents.

## Living room

The living room on A floor is available for meeting, studying, or other activities.

### Amenities

There is a **communal kitchen** available in the living room. A fridge is available. The ovens and stovetops are most likely turned off. Contact [building management]({{'building-management' | absolute_url}}) if you would like to make use of these facilities.

There is a **beamer** and projection screen. Use an HDMI cable in order to project your laptop or other device to the screen. The projection screen can be lowered and raised through the switch near the far wall.

A small **library** is located in this area. You are free to take any of the books here, as long as you make sure to return them. Feel free to add books to this collection.

A **chessboard**, supplied by residents, is available for use as well.

Moreover, there is a **vending machine** present in the living room.

## Laundry room

The laundry room in the basement contains a couch and can be used to relax while you wait for your laundry to be finished. The [Miele laundry boutique]({{'/services/laundry-boutique' | absolute_url}}) is located in this area.

## Pool house

The pool house on B-floor can be used to chill while watching a movie on the television screen. You can use an HDMI cable to project movies on the screen from your laptop.

## Study rooms

A study room is located on floors C and D. They are intended to be places to study in relative peace. Be mindful of anyone using these spaces to study.

A projector is available in both study rooms. Turn on the projector by pressing the button on the bottom of the device and use the HDMI port in the table to project your screen.
